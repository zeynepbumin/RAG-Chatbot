## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain

This workshop teaches how to build RAG systems that overcome Large Language Model limitations by augmenting prompts with retrieved external information from documents.

### What You'll Learn

**Core Concept**: Build RAG systems that address LLM limitations (hallucinations, outdated knowledge, lack of domain-specific data) by retrieving relevant information from external documents and combining it with your queries.

#### Learning Objectives

By completing this workshop, you will:

1. **Understand RAG fundamentals** - Learn why RAG is needed vs. fine-tuning, and how it provides transparent outputs with fewer hallucinations
2. **Document processing** - Load PDFs and chunk text to fit LLM context windows
3. **Embeddings & vector storage** - Convert text to numerical vectors using HuggingFace models and store them in FAISS vector database
4. **Retrieval systems** - Implement semantic similarity search to find relevant documents
5. **LLM integration** - Connect retrieval systems to language models (using free Groq/Llama models)
6. **Build interactive Q&A** - Create a chat interface for querying PDF documents

### Technical Stack

- **LangChain** - Framework for LLM applications
- **FAISS** - Facebook's similarity search library for vector storage
- **HuggingFace Embeddings** - Open-source embedding models
- **Groq/Llama** - Free LLM inference
- **Sample data** - Research papers included for practice (pharmaceutical documentation and AI research)

### Workshop Structure

Two parallel notebooks are provided:
- **RAG-Pipeline-Llama.ipynb** - Complete walkthrough with detailed explanations and working code
- **RAG_Exercise_Notebook.ipynb** - Hands-on exercises with empty functions for you to implement

The workshop covers 7 exercises that guide you through the 5-step RAG pipeline shown below.

### Prerequisites

You will need a free Groq API key. Create a `.env` file in the project root with:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=<your groq api key>
```

### RAG Workflow Explained

![RAG Workflow Diagram](./Images/RAG_steps.png)

The RAG system operates in two main stages: **Ingestion** (preparing your knowledge base) and **Inference** (answering user queries).

#### **Ingestion Stage** (Preparing Your Knowledge Base)

This stage happens once to prepare your documents for retrieval.

![Ingestion Stage - Steps 1 & 2](./Images/RAG_step1_step2.png)

**STEP 1 - Load Documents**: Start with your source documents (PDFs, text files, etc.)

**STEP 2 - Pre-processing & Chunking**: Split documents into smaller chunks that fit within LLM context windows. This makes retrieval more precise and manageable.

![Ingestion Stage - Step 3](./Images/RAG_step3.png)

**STEP 3 - Create Embeddings**: Use an embedding model to convert each chunk into a numerical vector representation. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text and are stored in a Vector Database (like FAISS) for efficient similarity search.

#### **Inference Stage** (Answering User Queries)

This stage happens every time a user asks a question and consists of three phases: Retrieval, Augmentation, and Generation.

![Inference Stage - Steps 4 & 5](./Images/RAG_step4_step5.png)

**Retrieval Phase (Step 4):**
- When a user submits a query, it gets converted into an embedding using the same embedding model
- The system performs similarity search in the Vector Database, comparing the query embedding against stored chunk embeddings
- The most relevant chunks (context) are retrieved based on similarity scores

**Augmentation Phase (Step 5):**
- The original query text is combined with the retrieved context using a prompt template
- This creates an enriched prompt that contains both the user's question and relevant background information

**Generation Phase (Step 5):**
- The enriched prompt is sent to the LLM (Large Language Model)
- The LLM generates a response based on both the query and the retrieved context
- The response is returned to the user

This workflow ensures that the LLM has access to relevant, up-to-date information from your documents, reducing hallucinations and improving answer accuracy.

## Real-World Applications of RAG Systems
